-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- INSTRUCTIONS
-- (Use sub queries or views wherever necessary)


-- 1. Create a database called house_price_regression.

-- CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS house_price_regression;

-- USE house_price_regression;


-- 2. Create a table house_price_data with the same columns as given in the csv file. 
-- Please make sure you use the correct data types for the columns.

-- DROP TABLE IF EXISTS house_price_data;

CREATE TABLE house_price_data (
    property_id BIGINT DEFAULT NULL,
    date TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
    bedrooms INT DEFAULT NULL,
    bathrooms DOUBLE DEFAULT NULL,
    sqft_living INT DEFAULT NULL,
    sqft_lot INT DEFAULT NULL,
    floors INT DEFAULT NULL,
    waterfront INT DEFAULT NULL,
    `view` INT DEFAULT NULL,
    `condition` INT DEFAULT NULL,
    grade INT DEFAULT NULL,
    sqft_above INT DEFAULT NULL,
    sqft_basement INT DEFAULT NULL,
    yr_built INT DEFAULT NULL,
    yr_renovated INT DEFAULT NULL,
    zip_code INT DEFAULT NULL,
    lat DOUBLE DEFAULT NULL,
    lon DOUBLE DEFAULT NULL,
    sqft_living15 INT DEFAULT NULL,
    sqft_lot15 INT DEFAULT NULL,
    price INT DEFAULT NULL
);

ALTER TABLE house_price_data ADD COLUMN id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY FIRST;

-- Change column names that are reserved words in MySQL

ALTER TABLE house_price_data CHANGE COLUMN `view` house_view INT;
ALTER TABLE house_price_data CHANGE COLUMN `condition` house_condition INT;

-- 3. Import the data from the csv file into the table. 
--         Before you import the data into the empty table, make sure that you have deleted the headers from the csv file. 
--         To not modify the original data, if you want you can create a copy of the csv file as well. 
--         Note you might have to use the following queries to give permission to SQL to import data from csv files in bulk:

--         SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'local_infile'; 
--         This query would show you the status of the variable ‘local_infile’. If it is off, use the next command, 
--         otherwise you should be good to go
--         SET GLOBAL local_infile = 1;


-- Since  local_infile import didn't work:

-- IMPORT DATA FROM CSV FILE: 
-- Create table with matching column number as import data and specify data format. (Previous step)
-- DO NOT specify primary key since, in this case, property_id doesn't have unique number. (Previous step)
-- Refresh table schema to view created table, right click on created table and click Table Data Import Wizard. (Previous step)
-- Select csv file and match format (8 UTI).
-- Data file should not have headers. 
-- Create new column id set on autoincrement to assign specific identifier for each row. Set as primary key.


USE house_price_regression;
-- 4.  Select all the data from table `house_price_data` to check if the data was imported correctly

SELECT * FROM house_price_data;

-- 5.  Use the alter table command to drop the column `date` from the database, as we would not use it in the analysis with SQL. Select all the data from the table to verify if the command worked. Limit your returned results to 10.

ALTER TABLE house_price_data
DROP COLUMN date;

SELECT *
FROM house_price_data
LIMIT 10;


-- 6.  Use sql query to find how many rows of data you have.

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows
FROM house_price_data;


-- 7.  Now we will try to find the unique values in some of the categorical columns:

USE house_price_regression;

    -- What are the unique values in the column `bedrooms`?
    SELECT DISTINCT bedrooms
	FROM house_price_data
    ORDER BY bedrooms;
    
    -- What are the unique values in the column `bathrooms`?
    SELECT DISTINCT bathrooms
	FROM house_price_data
    ORDER BY bathrooms;

    -- What are the unique values in the column `floors`?
    SELECT DISTINCT floors
	FROM house_price_data
    ORDER BY floors;

    
    -- What are the unique values in the column `condition`?
    SELECT DISTINCT house_condition
	FROM house_price_data
    ORDER BY house_condition;

    -- What are the unique values in the column `grade`?
    SELECT DISTINCT grade
	FROM house_price_data
    ORDER BY grade;


-- 8.  Arrange the data in a decreasing order by the price of the house. Return only the IDs of the top 10 most expensive houses in your data.
SELECT id, property_id, price
FROM house_price_data
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 9.  What is the average price of all the properties in your data?
SELECT ROUND(AVG(price), 2) AS average_price
FROM house_price_data;


-- 10. In this exercise we will use simple group by to check the properties of some of the categorical variables in our data

    -- What is the average price of the houses grouped by bedrooms? The returned result should have only two columns, bedrooms and Average of the prices. Use an alias to change the name of the second column.
    SELECT bedrooms, AVG(price) AS average_price
	FROM house_price_data
	GROUP BY bedrooms;

    
    -- What is the average `sqft_living` of the houses grouped by bedrooms? The returned result should have only two columns, bedrooms and Average of the `sqft_living`. Use an alias to change the name of the second column.
    SELECT bedrooms, AVG(sqft_living) AS average_sqft_living
	FROM house_price_data
	GROUP BY bedrooms;

    
    -- What is the average price of the houses with a waterfront and without a waterfront? The returned result should have only two columns, waterfront and `Average` of the prices. Use an alias to change the name of the second column.
    SELECT waterfront, AVG(price) AS average_price
	FROM house_price_data
	GROUP BY waterfront;

    -- Is there any correlation between the columns `condition` and `grade`? You can analyse this by grouping the data by one of the variables and then aggregating the results of the other column. Visually check if there is a positive correlation or negative correlation or no correlation between the variables.
	SELECT house_condition, AVG(grade) AS average_grade
	FROM house_price_data
	GROUP BY house_condition;

-- 11. One of the customers is only interested in the following houses:

    -- Number of bedrooms either 3 or 4
    -- Bathrooms more than 3
    -- One Floor
    -- No waterfront
    -- Condition should be 3 at least
    -- Grade should be 5 at least
    -- Price less than 300000
	-- For the rest of the things, they are not too concerned. Write a simple query to find what are the options available for them?
SELECT *
FROM house_price_data
WHERE bedrooms IN (3, 4)
  AND bathrooms > 3
  AND floors = 1
  AND waterfront = 0
  AND house_condition >= 3
  AND grade >= 5
  AND price < 300000;


-- 12. Your manager wants to find out the list of properties whose prices are twice more than the average of all the properties in the database. Write a query to show them the list of such properties. You might need to use a sub query for this problem.
SELECT *
FROM house_price_data
WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) * 2 FROM house_price_data);

-- 13. Since this is something that the senior management is regularly interested in, create a view of the same query.
CREATE VIEW properties_twice_avg AS
SELECT *
FROM house_price_data
WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) * 2 FROM house_price_data);

SELECT *
FROM properties_twice_avg;

-- 14. Most customers are interested in properties with three or four bedrooms. What is the difference in average prices of the properties with three and four bedrooms?
SELECT bedrooms, AVG(price) AS average_price
FROM house_price_data
WHERE bedrooms IN (3, 4)
GROUP BY bedrooms;

-- 15. What are the different locations where properties are available in your database? (distinct zip codes)
SELECT DISTINCT zip_code
FROM house_price_data;

-- 16. Show the list of all the properties that were renovated.
SELECT *
FROM house_price_data
WHERE yr_renovated > 0;


-- 17. Provide the details of the property that is the 11th most expensive property in your database.
SELECT *
FROM house_price_data
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 10;

-- Average price by bedrooms

SELECT bedrooms, ROUND(AVG(price), 2) AS average_price
FROM house_price_data
GROUP BY bedrooms
ORDER BY bedrooms;

-- Average price by bathrooms

SELECT bathrooms, ROUND(AVG(price), 2) AS average_price
FROM house_price_data
GROUP BY bathrooms
ORDER BY bathrooms;

-- Average price by sqft_living15

SELECT sqft_living15, ROUND(AVG(price), 2) AS average_price
FROM house_price_data
GROUP BY sqft_living15;

-- Average price by grade

SELECT grade, ROUND(AVG(price), 2) AS average_price
FROM house_price_data
GROUP BY grade
ORDER BY grade;

-- Average price by floors

SELECT floors, ROUND(AVG(price), 2) AS average_price
FROM house_price_data
GROUP BY floors
ORDER BY floors;

-- Top 15 most expensive properties 

SELECT property_id, floors, bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft_living15, grade, ROUND(price, 2) AS price
FROM house_price_data
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 10;
